# Project time tracker: React

Simple time tracking software. Create projects and measure the time spent on them. Part of my thesis project.

## Run project

```
npm install // Install dependencies
npm start   // Run server. App is running at http://localhost:3000.
```

This project requires server-side application in order to run correctly. Server app and its instructions can be found here: https://github.com/seppotarvainen/jyu-st-backend

## Study

The idea of the study is to compare maintainability of the front-end applications done with different JavaScript frameworks. This project is also made with [Angular5](https://github.com/seppotarvainen/jyu-st-angular5) and [AngularJS](https://github.com/seppotarvainen/jyu-st-angularjs). Maintainability is measured with [sonarcloud](https://about.sonarcloud.io/).
